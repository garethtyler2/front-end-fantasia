            In this guide, we'll explore the <strong>goals of prehab</strong>, who benefits the most, and why it's a game-changer in health,

          <h2 className="mb-4 text-2xl md:text-3xl">Key Goals of Prehab</h2>
          <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
            The primary objectives of prehab focus on creating a stronger, more resilient body while improving movement and reducing 
            risks of injury. Here are the main goals:
          </p>
          <ul className="space-y-4 list-disc pl-6 text-lg">
            <li>
              <strong>Injury Prevention:</strong> Strengthen muscles, joints, and ligaments to enhance resilience against stress 
              or trauma. Improve movement mechanics to minimize strain on vulnerable areas and avoid common injuries like 
              sprains, strains, or overuse conditions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Surgical Preparation:</strong> Prehab exercises prepare your body for surgery by building strength, 
              stability, and mobility around the affected area. Stronger, more mobile patients experience faster and more 
              complete recovery post-surgery.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Performance Enhancement:</strong> Athletes benefit by addressing weak points or imbalances that limit 
              performance. Prehab improves flexibility, strength, and coordination to prevent injuries during intense physical activity.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Chronic Condition Management:</strong> Manage or delay the progression of conditions like arthritis, 
              osteoporosis, or lower back pain. Prehab maintains joint stability, mobility, and overall quality of life.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="mb-4 text-2xl md:text-3xl">Who Can Benefit from Prehab?</h2>
          <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
            Prehab is suitable for everyone, from professional athletes to everyday individuals. Here's how different groups 
            can benefit from incorporating prehabilitation into their routines:
          </p>
          <ul className="space-y-4 list-disc pl-6 text-lg">
            <li>
              <strong>Athletes:</strong> Reduce the risk of sports-related injuries, recover safely from existing ones, and 
              improve performance in competitive sports like running, cycling, or weightlifting.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Surgical Patients:</strong> Prepare for surgeries such as ACL reconstruction, joint replacements, or 
              rotator cuff repairs. A stronger, more prepared body enhances post-operative outcomes and recovery speed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Everyday Individuals:</strong> Prevent injuries caused by repetitive movements, poor posture, or workplace 
              strain. Prehab exercises help maintain physical health and avoid common musculoskeletal issues.
            </li>
          </ul>
